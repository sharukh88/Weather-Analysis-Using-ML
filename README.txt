HOW TO RUN THIS CODE:

First, make sure to download the jupyter notebook environment.
If you can, I recommend downloading Anaconda Navigator as it has everything you need all in one. 

Once you have the enviroment downloaded, navigate to the file in jupyter notebook. This is like opening any other file.

Now there are two ways to run this code.
First Way: If you want, you can just open the code in jupyter notebook and see the code already pre runned. You only have to look at two files, data_preprocessing.ipynb and project.ipynb. 

Second Way: Let's say you actually have to run the project, then first open  data_preprocessing.ipynb, and run click on the run button until it goes through all of the cells. So this means that you will have to click on the run button multiple times. ALSO, if you see [*] on a cell, then this means that the code is running on that cell. So give it time until it is finished, you will know it is finished if it has a number inside []. The files are big in this project so it takes time to fully run each cell. Next, once you go through all of the cells, go ahead and go to project.ipynb and run those cells. NOTE, the cells in these files take a lot longer since we are training each model, so please be patient.

This code works, we have tested it multiple times. If by any chance you need to redownload the dataset file, please go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/global-daily-climate-data
Download the zip file, unzip the file, and store it into the project file. After that follow the second way step above.
